# TinyML

TinyML is a project assigned during the Functional Language course at University of Padua.
The original source of the project is at the following link <https://github.com/alvisespano/FL-unipd-2021-22>. 
TinyML is a compiler, mainly a type checker for a tiny subset of the language ML.

## Implementation

The teacher provided a scheleton of the project: 

 - parser
 - type checker
 - evaluator.
 
 Students were asked to implement the type inference algorithm and all of its subfunction (Algorithm W):
 
  - substitution
  - composition of substitution
  - unification
  - finally the inference itself.
